## UESocialMediaAggregator

This group project is developed as part of Usability Engineering course at PSU.

### Problem Summary

It is clear that social media has become an indispensable part of everyday life for people all over the world. Many users find it time-consuming to manage multiple social media accounts. One of the many challenges people are facing today has been processing the excessive amount of social media posts over numerous platforms. We wanted to lessen the overall overload of information that users would be viewing on a daily basis by allowing them to organize their various social media platforms into a single source. We researched and prototyped interface alternatives to put as many social media platforms as we could under one roof so that users can manage their total time spent on social media. This also allows for the ability to take in new platforms as the landscape evolves.

### Our Work

This project presents the final high-fidelity interface prototype for our mobile social media aggregator app and discusses the justification of design decisions based on our initial research, design principles, analytical and empirical evaluations for the prototype. This was done in order to address usability problems with modern social media platforms and improve the experience for users of multiple social media platforms.
